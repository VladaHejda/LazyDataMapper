Aggregating data queries
===

Let's extend our example from [previous chapter](8.Behind-the-curtain.md):

```html
<?php
$restrictor = new Product\Restrictor;
$restrictor->limitPrice(200);
$products = $productFacade->getByRestrictions($restrictor);
?>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Product</th><th>Description</th><th>Price</th><th>Rating</th><th>Review</th>
	</tr>

<?php foreach ($products as $product) { ?>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<?php echo $product->name; ?>
		</td><td>
			<?php echo $product->description; ?>
		</td><td>
			<?php echo $product->price; ?> USD
		</td><td>
			<?php echo $product->review->rating; ?>
		</td><td>
			<?php echo $product->review->text; ?>
		</td>
	</tr>

<?php } ?>

</table>
```

There you see that necessary data expanded by following:

- review rating (`$product->review->rating`)
- review text (`$product->review->text`)

Normally:

- *ProductMapper* gets `['name', 'description', 'price']` suggestions,
- then *Product* Entity gets child *review* Entity by [`getChild()`](3.Entity-reading.md#entity-hierarchy) method
- and finally *ReviewMapper* gets suggestions `['rating', 'text']`.

## Dependencies

But that's not the maximum that you can wring out of LazyDataMapper!

As we have [JOINs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28SQL%29) in SQL, we can select review together with
product in one SQL query. LazyDataMapper give us a tool for this.

The **Suggestor** offers child suggestor(s) named by Entity name. So as we have Suggestor inside *ProductMapper*,
which gives us suggestion "name", "description" and "price", there is another, child **Suggestor**, available in
`$suggestor->review`, which give us suggestions "rating" and "text".

Let's use it in our ProductMapper:

```php
class ProductMapper extends \LazyDataMapper\Mapper
{

	// ...

	public function getById($id, Suggestor $suggestor, DataHolder $holder = NULL)
	{
		$join = '';

		$productParams = $suggestor->getSuggestions();
		$columns = '`' . implode('`,`', $productParams) . '`';

		if ($suggestor->review) {
			$reviewParams = $suggestor->review->getSuggestions();
			$columns .= ', `' . implode('`,`', $reviewParams) . '`';
			$join = "LEFT JOIN review USING(product_id)";
		}

		$statement = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT $columns FROM product $join WHERE product_id = ?");
		$statement->execute( [$id] );
		$result = $statement->fetch();

		$holder->setData($result);

		if ($suggestor->review) {
			$holder->review->setData($result);
		}

		return $holder;
	}
}
```

And we have all data for the page from one SQL query.

### Dependencies under dependencies

Dependencies can go deeper and deeper. On our product list example page we can get e.g. `$product->review->author->name`.
And in Mapper we get Suggestor, which give us `['name']` in `$suggestor->review->author->getSuggestions()`.
We can join the *authors* table and load all data in one query.

## Hierarchy forks

Till now we have just aggregated only single Entity hierarchy (**one** Product → **one** review → **one** author).

However LazyDataMapper allows to aggregate whole hierarchy.

For first imagine that one product may have several reviews instead of one only:

```html
<?php
$restrictor = new Product\Restrictor;
$restrictor->limitPrice(200);
$products = $productFacade->getByRestrictions($restrictor);
?>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Product</th><th>Reviews</th>
	</tr>

<?php foreach ($products as $product) { ?>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<?php echo $product->name; ?>
		</td><td>
			<ul>
			<?php foreach ($product->reviews as $review) { ?>
				<li>
					<?php echo $review->header; ?>
				</li>
			<?php } ?>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>

<?php } ?>

</table>
```

Now involve reviews into one query together with product:

```php
class ProductMapper extends \LazyDataMapper\Mapper
{

	// ...

	public function getById($id, Suggestor $suggestor, DataHolder $holder = NULL)
	{
		$join = '';

		$productParams = $suggestor->getSuggestions();
		$columns = '`' . implode('`,`', $productParams) . '`';

		if ($suggestor->reviews) {
			$reviewParams = $suggestor->reviews->getSuggestions();
			$columns .= ', `' . implode('`,`', $reviewParams) . '`';
			$join = "LEFT JOIN review USING(product_id)";
		}

		$statement = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT $columns FROM product $join WHERE product_id = ?");
		$statement->execute( [$id] );

		$row = $statement->fetch();
		$holder->setData($row);

		if ($suggestor->reviews) {
			do {
				if ($row['review_id']) {    // prevents products with no review
					$holder->reviews->setData( [$row['review_id'] => $row] );
				}

			} while ($row = $statement->fetch());
		}

		return $holder;
	}
}
```

Now again, we have all data for the page from one SQL query.

### Forks after forks

Let's expand reviews by their authors:

```html
<?php
$restrictor = new Product\Restrictor;
$restrictor->limitPrice(200);
$products = $productFacade->getByRestrictions($restrictor);
?>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Product</th><th>Reviews</th>
	</tr>

<?php foreach ($products as $product) { ?>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<?php echo $product->name; ?>
		</td><td>
			<ul>
			<?php foreach ($product->reviews as $review) { ?>
				<li>
					<?php echo $review->header; ?>
					( <?php echo $review->author->name; ?> )   // here we get review author name
				</li>
			<?php } ?>
			</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>

<?php } ?>

</table>
```

This situation brings one little problem, namely that if you set authors data by
`$holder->reviews->author->setData( $authorsData );`, LazyDataMapper does not know which author is related to
which review?

This solves method `setRelation()` (respectively `setParentIds()` or `setChildrenIds()`,
difference is [explained below](#relations-declaration-methods)).

See how ProductMapper changes:

```php
class ProductMapper extends \LazyDataMapper\Mapper
{

	// ...

	public function getById($id, Suggestor $suggestor, DataHolder $holder = NULL)
	{
		$join = '';

		$productParams = $suggestor->getSuggestions();
		$columns = '`' . implode('`,`', $productParams) . '`';

		if ($suggestor->reviews) {
			$reviewParams = $suggestor->reviews->getSuggestions();
			$columns .= ', `' . implode('`,`', $reviewParams) . '`';
			$join = "LEFT JOIN review USING(product_id)";
			$reviewParams = array_flip($reviewParams);

			if ($suggestor->reviews->author) {
				$authorParams = $suggestor->reviews->author->getSuggestions();
				$columns .= ', `' . implode('`,`', $authorParams) . '`';
				$join .= "LEFT JOIN author USING(author_id)";
				$authorParams = array_flip($authorParams);
			}
		}

		$statement = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT $columns FROM product $join WHERE product_id = ?");
		$statement->execute( [$id] );

		$row = $statement->fetch();
		$holder->setData($row);

		if ($suggestor->hasChildren()) {

			do {

				if ($suggestor->reviews && $row['review_id']) {
					$holder->reviews->setData( [$row['review_id'] => $row] );
				}

				if ($suggestor->reviews->author && $row['author_id']) {

					// first, set relation of review and author:
					$holder->reviews->author->setRelation( $row['author_id'], $row['review_id'] );

					// then set data
					$holder->reviews->author->setData( [$row['author_id'] => $row] );
				}

			} while ($row = $statement->fetch());
		}

		return $holder;
	}
}
```

Now, if everything success, we have all again aggregated into one SQL query.

### Relations declaration methods

Alternatively to `setRelation()` method there is several different ways to declare relations.

#### `setChildrenIds()` or `setParentIds()`

If you are more suited to set all relations together, use one of these two methods like this:

```php
$relations = [
	10 => 55,         // product (parent) ID => review (child) ID
	11 => 60,
	12 => 60          // one child can have several parents
	13 => [ 65, 66 ]  // one parent can have several children
];

$holder->setChildrenIds( $relations );
```

Or equal relations set by `setParentIds()` method:

```php
$relations = [
	55 => 10,          // review (child) ID => product (parent) ID
	60 => [ 11, 12 ],
	65 => 13,
	66 => 13,
];

$holder->setParentIds( $relations );
```

#### Set id and relations by source key name

If you load data the same way as mentioned in our examples (from SQL database),
you can consider useful two other DataHolder's methods: `setIdSource()` and `setParentIdSource()`.

If you set the source keys, where desired IDs can be found, into these methods,
you do not have to set relations by previous ways.
Then you just give whole database result into `setData()` method
and DataHolder will consume only what he wants.

At first simplify for example *reviews* data setting in last example. Now we have
`$holder->reviews->setData( [$row['review_id'] => $row] )` - we must set the ID of *review*
in index of array given to `setData()` method.

If we use the `setIdSource()` method, we do not have to do it. Look at this equivalent:

```php
$holder->reviews->setIdSource( 'review_id' )->setData( $row );
```

Now, modify our last example with these methods:

```php
class ProductMapper extends \LazyDataMapper\Mapper
{

	// ...

	public function getById($id, Suggestor $suggestor, DataHolder $holder = NULL)
	{
		$join = '';

		$productParams = $suggestor->getSuggestions();
		$columns = '`' . implode('`,`', $productParams) . '`';

		if ($suggestor->reviews) {
			$reviewParams = $suggestor->reviews->getSuggestions();
			$columns .= ', `' . implode('`,`', $reviewParams) . '`';
			$join = "LEFT JOIN review USING(product_id)";

			if ($suggestor->reviews->author) {
				$authorParams = $suggestor->reviews->author->getSuggestions();
				$columns .= ', `' . implode('`,`', $authorParams) . '`';
				$join .= "LEFT JOIN author USING(author_id)";
			}
		}

		$statement = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT $columns FROM product $join WHERE product_id = ?");
		$statement->execute( [$id] );

		$row = $statement->fetch();
		$holder->setData($row);

		do {

			if ($suggestor->reviews->author && $row['author_id']) {
				$holder->reviews->author
					->setParentIdSource( 'review_id' )
					->setIdSource( 'author_id' )
					->setData( $row );
			}

			if ($suggestor->reviews && $row['review_id']) {
				$holder->reviews
					->setIdSource( 'review_id' )
					->setData( $row );
			}

		} while ($row = $statement->fetch());

		return $holder;
	}
}
```

Here, in `do` loop in second conditional block you do not have to set parent ID source, because all *review*
children has the same parent - the *product* and LazyDataMapper knows it.

In first conditional block we set parent ID source. But notice, that parent ID source of *authors* is the same
as ID source of *reviews*. So if we switch both conditional blocks, we can omit setting parent ID source
of *authors*, LazyDataMapper gives it from ID source of *reviews*. Then `do` loop can be simplified as following:

```php
do {
	if ($suggestor->reviews && $row['review_id']) {
		$holder->reviews
			->setIdSource( 'review_id' )
			->setData( $row );

	if ($suggestor->reviews->author && $row['author_id']) {
		$holder->reviews->author
			->setIdSource( 'author_id' )
			->setData( $row );
	}
}
```

Now you have read exhaustive explanation of relations declaring ways.

*And remember, where is it possible all DataHolder method provides fluent interface, so use it as much as you can.*
