Restrictors
===

Getting `EntityContainer` by range of ids was introduced at
[EntityContainer DOC](https://github.com/VladaHejda/LazyDataMapper/blob/master/DOC/6.EntityContainer.md).
But always you will not know ids of items you want. So LazyDataMapper offers interface `IRestrictor`
where you can implement all kind of conditions, limits and restrictions to find coveted ids.

Implementation is all up to you. Inspire by following example:

```php
class ProductRestrictor implements \LazyDataMapper\IRestrictor
{
	protected $conditions = [];

	protected $parameters = [];

	public function limitColor($color)
	{
		$this->conditions[] = "color = ?";
		$this->parameters[] = $color;
	}

	public function limitPrice($min, $max = NULL)
	{
		if (NULL !== $min) {
			$this->conditions[] = "price >= ?";
			$this->parameters[] = $min;
		}
		if (NULL !== $max) {
			$this->conditions[] = "price <= ?";
			$this->parameters[] = $max;
		}
	}

	public function getRestrictions()
	{
		return [
			implode(' AND ', $this->conditions),
			$this->parameters
		];
	}
}
```

Restrictor must be compatible with Mapper's method `getIdsByRestrictions()`. Mentioned Restrictor could have
following Mapper's implementation:

```php
class ProductMapper implements \LazyDataMapper\IMapper
{
	// ...

	public function getIdsByRestrictions(\LazyDataMapper\IRestrictor $restrictor)
	{
		list($conditions, $parameters) = $restrictor->getRestrictions();
		$statement = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT id FROM product WHERE $conditions");
		$statement->execute($parameters);
		$ids = [];
		while ($id = $statement->fetchColumn()) {
			$ids[] = $id;
		}
		return $ids;
	}
}
```

As you can see, `getIdsByRestrictions()` must return array of matched ids.

After that you can get entities by restrictions:

```php
$productRestrictor = new \ProductRestrictor;
$productRestrictor->limitColor('red');
$productRestrictor->limitPrice(NULL, 250);

// following returns all red products whose price does not exceed 250
$products = $productFacade->getByRestrictions($productRestrictor);
```
