Behind the curtain
===

For understanding next chapter it should be conductive to know something about how LazyDataMapper works inside.

Imagine situation:

In your real application, you will have pages. Pages will have addresses.
So imagine page on **www.your-app.tld/shop/productList.php** URL and part of its source HTML:

```html
<?php
$restrictor = new Product\Restrictor;
$restrictor->limitPrice(200);
$products = $productFacade->getByRestrictions($restrictor);
?>

<table>

	<tr>
		<th>Product</th><th>Description</th><th>Price</th>
	</tr>

<?php foreach ($products as $product) { ?>

	<tr>
		<td>
			<?php echo $product->name; ?>
		</td><td>
			<?php echo $product->description; ?>
		</td><td>
			<?php echo $product->price; ?> USD
		</td>
	</tr>

<?php } ?>

</table>
```

There you see that data needed on this page are

- product name
- product description
- product price

LazyDataMapper executes and now he knows that on the page with URI **shop/productList.php**
there are these data needed to load from data storage.

Next time the *ProductMapper* , [as you could see at the beginnings](../1.Installation.md#mapper), gets **Suggestor**
which has three suggestions. That means, that the `$suggestor->getSuggestions()` returns array such as:
`['name', 'description', 'price']`. And you will query only these data.

## IRequestKey interface

The problem is that LazyDataMapper does not know the structure of your application.

If there will be the request for page
**www.your-app.tld/shop/productList.php?show=50**, LazyDataMapper will think that it is the same page as
**www.your-app.tld/shop/productList.php** and probably it will be right.

But consider the script for administration: **www.your-app.tld/admin.php**. Under this page can be
sub-pages like **www.your-app.tld/admin.php?section=users** and **www.your-app.tld/admin.php?section=sales**
and it does not seem like same pages. It will be probably pages with entirely different content.

Regarding on your specific app it may be necessary to implement your own
[`LazyDataMapper\IRequestKey`](../src/interfaces/IRequestKey.php).
It has one method, `getKey()`, that just have to return the page-dependent-hash. It does not matter,
what the hash will be, it has just two rules:

- it is a string
- it does not interfere with another independent page

For inspiration, look at:

### Default RequestKey

[Pre-implemented RequestKey](../src/RequestKey.php) distinguishes pages based on URI
truncated of the query string. This implies that:

- When requested page will be **www.your-app.tld/shop/productList.php**,
RequestKey will extract the hash `shop/productList.php`.

- When requested page will be **www.your-app.tld/shop/productList.php?show=50**,
RequestKey will consider the hash `shop/productList.php`, so the same as previous.
Suggestions in **Suggestor** will be the same on both page requests.

- But when there will occur the request for page **www.your-app.tld/shop/reviews.php**, the hash will be
`shop/reviews.php`, so suggestions become different.
